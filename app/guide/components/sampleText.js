      <h1><strong>Board of Directors Oversight</strong></h1>
      <br/>
      <p>The Company's Board oversees the business and affairs of the Company, providing active and independent oversight of management, including management's development and execution of our climate-related strategy and activities. Our directors are seasoned leaders who bring deep and diverse experience from a range of industries and backgrounds. Their perspectives, experiences and expertise help inform and guide how we deliver long-term, sustainable value for our shareholders and share success with our communities.</p>
      <p>Our Board is keenly focused on its composition and succession planning. When evaluating and identifying director candidates, the Board considers the experiences, skills and expertise that are critical to its ability to provide effective oversight of the Company and are directly relevant to our Company's business, strategy and operations. In addition, the Board, through its Corporate Governance, ESG and Sustainability Committee (CGESC), follows applicable regulations in confirming that the Board includes members with an understanding of risk management principles, policies and practices, and experience in identifying, assessing and managing risk exposures. Our Board understands the importance of director education to directors in fulfilling their oversight responsibilities. All new directors participate in our director orientation program during their first six months of service, through a series of meetings with management representing all business and staff areas. Continuing director education is provided as part of formal Board and committee meetings and as stand-alone information sessions outside of those meetings.</p>
      <p>For example, in 2023, in response to director input, our Board and committees held more frequent discussions with management on implementation of the Company's sustainability initiatives, climate activities and new climate disclosure requirements. In 2024, at the CGESC's request, the Board held a stand-alone information session to review the Company's sustainability initiatives, including its voluntary commitments and the regulatory requirements it is subject to. The Board has adopted thoughtful governance practices and processes consistent with the Company's drive toward Responsible Growth. A key tenet of Responsible Growth is to grow in a sustainable manner. The Board and its committees actively oversee the Company's drive to grow in a sustainable manner through comprehensive governance and risk oversight practices, including through regular review and discussion of climate-related topics.</p>
      <br/>
      <h2>Examples of Oversight</h2>
      <ul>
          <li>•The Board receives periodic presentations from management on climate topics, including the Company's progress toward its Net Zero goal and sustainable finance target.</li>
          <li>•The Board's Enterprise Risk Committee (ERC) oversees risk, including reputational risk and climate risk, and receives updates as needed on the continued enhancement to and evolution of the Company's climate risk management efforts and overall climate program. The Board and the ERC receive risk reporting on key and emerging risks, including climate risk.</li>
          <li>•The Board's CGESC, which has specific responsibility for overseeing the Company's environmental and social sustainability-related activities and practices, reviews (at least annually) the Company's climate-related work, including its sustainable finance activities, 2030 Financing Activity Targets and certain climate reports.</li>
          <li>•The Board's Audit Committee oversees the integrity of the Company's financial reporting, including sustainability-related disclosures, and reviews the Company's enterprise climate disclosures in its financial reports filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. The Audit Committee also receives regular updates on the evolving regulatory landscape and development of climate-related disclosure requirements.</li>
          <li>•The Board's Compensation and Human Capital Committee oversees the Company's human capital management practices and promotes strong governance of our pay-for-performance compensation philosophy, which includes considerations related to growth in a sustainable manner with focused sustainability leadership, as detailed in the Performance and Remuneration section.</li>

        <h1><strong>Board and Committees</strong></h1>
        <br/>
    <p>Climate change is a Board-level issue, including in relation to our strategic approach, risk management, public disclosures, annual budgets and business plans. The Board is responsible for the approval and oversight of BHP’s climate-related risks (threats and opportunities) and BHP’s climate change strategy. The Board has four standing Committees to assist in the discharge of its responsibilities, including in relation to climate-related matters. Each of these Committees reports to the Board on the key issues discussed, including, where applicable, climate-related issues:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>•The Board approves BHP’s significant social, community and sustainability policies (upon recommendation from the Nomination and Governance Committee), including those related to climate change and climate transition planning, public sustainability-related goals and targets (including for GHG emission reductions). The Board reviewed and approved BHP’s climate-related targets and goals, and approved this CTAP.</li>
        <li>•The Nomination and Governance Committee assists the Board with reviewing BHP’s significant social, community and sustainability-related policies (including those related to climate change and climate transition planning), and reviews and makes recommendations to the Board on BHP’s public sustainability-related targets and goals. The Nomination and Governance Committee reviewed and recommended this CTAP to the Board for approval. The Committee also assists with assessing the capability of the Board to deliver on BHP’s strategy by regularly assessing the Board skills matrix and the collective skills, experience and knowledge of the Board to be able to discharge its duties, including on the strategic direction of BHP.</li>
        <li>•The Sustainability Committee assists the Board with overseeing climate performance, including monitoring implementation of BHP’s climate strategy, policies and processes, and performance against public targets and goals, and reviews and reports to the Board on the Group’s material climate risks. The Committee also makes recommendations to the People and Remuneration Committee on both setting climate performance measures and evaluating performance against those measures for the CEO and other members of the ELT.</li>
        <li>•The Risk and Audit Committee oversees and assists the Board in reviewing the emerging and principal risks facing BHP. This includes business risk, financial reporting risk and climate risk. The Committee also reviews and recommends to the Board for approval public financial disclosures, including financial information related to sustainability matters and financial information contained in climate change reports and climate transition action plans. The Risk and Audit Committee reviewed the climate-related financial disclosures appearing in this CTAP and the Financial Statements in the BHP Annual Report 2024, both prior to the Board’s approval.</li>
        <li>•The People and Remuneration Committee assists the Board with reviewing performance measures and performance outcomes for the CEO and approves performance measures and assesses and determines performance outcomes against those performance measures for the ELT. In doing so, the Committee considers recommendations from the Sustainability Committee in relation to climate performance measures.</li>

    <h1><strong>Board of Directors Oversight</strong></h1>
    <br/>
    <p>The Company’s Board oversees the business and affairs of the Company, providing active and independent oversight of management, including management’s development and execution of our climate-related strategy and activities. Our directors are seasoned leaders who bring deep and diverse experience from a range of industries and backgrounds. Their perspectives, experiences and expertise help inform and guide how we deliver long-term, sustainable value for our shareholders and share success with our communities.</p>

    <p>Our Board is keenly focused on its composition and succession planning. When evaluating and identifying director candidates, the Board considers the experiences, skills and expertise that are critical to its ability to provide effective oversight of the Company and are directly relevant to our Company’s business, strategy and operations. In addition, the Board, through its Corporate Governance, ESG and Sustainability Committee (CGESC), follows applicable regulations in confirming that the Board includes members with an understanding of risk management principles, policies and practices, and experience in identifying, assessing and managing risk exposures. Our Board understands the importance of director education to directors in fulfilling their oversight responsibilities. All new directors participate in our director orientation program during their first six months of service, through a series of meetings with management representing all business and staff areas. Continuing director education is provided as part of formal Board and committee meetings and as stand-alone information sessions outside of those meetings.</p>

    <p>For example, in 2023, in response to director input, our Board and committees held more frequent discussions with management on implementation of the Company’s sustainability initiatives, climate activities and new climate disclosure requirements. In 2024, at the CGESC’s request, the Board held a stand-alone information session to review the Company’s sustainability initiatives, including its voluntary commitments and the regulatory requirements it is subject to. The Board has adopted thoughtful governance practices and processes consistent with the Company’s drive toward Responsible Growth. A key tenet of Responsible Growth is to grow in a sustainable manner. The Board and its committees actively oversee the Company’s drive to grow in a sustainable manner through comprehensive governance and risk oversight practices, including through regular review and discussion of climate-related topics.</p>

    <h2>Examples of Oversight</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>•The Board receives periodic presentations from management on climate topics, including the Company’s progress toward its Net Zero goal and sustainable finance target.</li>
        <li>•The Board’s Enterprise Risk Committee (ERC) oversees risk, including reputational risk and climate risk, and receives updates as needed on the continued enhancement to and evolution of the Company’s climate risk management efforts and overall climate program. The Board and the ERC receive risk reporting on key and emerging risks, including climate risk.</li>
        <li>•The Board’s CGESC, which has specific responsibility for overseeing the Company’s environmental and social sustainability-related activities and practices, reviews (at least annually) the Company’s climate-related work, including its sustainable finance activities, 2030 Financing Activity Targets and certain climate reports.</li>
        <li>•The Board’s Audit Committee oversees the integrity of the Company’s financial reporting, including sustainability-related disclosures, and reviews the Company’s enterprise climate disclosures in its financial reports filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. The Audit Committee also receives regular updates on the evolving regulatory landscape and development of climate-related disclosure requirements.</li>
        <li>•The Board’s Compensation and Human Capital Committee oversees the Company’s human capital management practices and promotes strong governance of our pay-for-performance compensation philosophy, which includes considerations related to growth in a sustainable manner with focused sustainability leadership, as detailed in the Performance and Remuneration section.</li>

        <h1><strong>Board and Committees</strong></h1>
        <br/>
    <p>Climate change is a Board-level issue, including in relation to our strategic approach, risk management, public disclosures, annual budgets and business plans. The Board is responsible for the approval and oversight of BHP’s climate-related risks (threats and opportunities) and BHP’s climate change strategy. The Board has four standing Committees to assist in the discharge of its responsibilities, including in relation to climate-related matters. Each of these Committees reports to the Board on the key issues discussed, including, where applicable, climate-related issues:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>•The Board approves BHP’s significant social, community and sustainability policies (upon recommendation from the Nomination and Governance Committee), including those related to climate change and climate transition planning, public sustainability-related goals and targets (including for GHG emission reductions). The Board reviewed and approved BHP’s climate-related targets and goals, and approved this CTAP.</li>
        <li>•The Nomination and Governance Committee assists the Board with reviewing BHP’s significant social, community and sustainability-related policies (including those related to climate change and climate transition planning), and reviews and makes recommendations to the Board on BHP’s public sustainability-related targets and goals. The Nomination and Governance Committee reviewed and recommended this CTAP to the Board for approval. The Committee also assists with assessing the capability of the Board to deliver on BHP’s strategy by regularly assessing the Board skills matrix and the collective skills, experience and knowledge of the Board to be able to discharge its duties, including on the strategic direction of BHP.</li>
        <li>•The Sustainability Committee assists the Board with overseeing climate performance, including monitoring implementation of BHP’s climate strategy, policies and processes, and performance against public targets and goals, and reviews and reports to the Board on the Group’s material climate risks. The Committee also makes recommendations to the People and Remuneration Committee on both setting climate performance measures and evaluating performance against those measures for the CEO and other members of the ELT.</li>
        <li>•The Risk and Audit Committee oversees and assists the Board in reviewing the emerging and principal risks facing BHP. This includes business risk, financial reporting risk and climate risk. The Committee also reviews and recommends to the Board for approval public financial disclosures, including financial information related to sustainability matters and financial information contained in climate change reports and climate transition action plans. The Risk and Audit Committee reviewed the climate-related financial disclosures appearing in this CTAP and the Financial Statements in the BHP Annual Report 2024, both prior to the Board’s approval.</li>
        <li>•The People and Remuneration Committee assists the Board with reviewing performance measures and performance outcomes for the CEO and approves performance measures and assesses and determines performance outcomes against those performance measures for the ELT. In doing so, the Committee considers recommendations from the Sustainability Committee in relation to climate performance measures.</li>

    <h1><strong>주요 의사결정 및 관리·감독 시, 기후 변화 관련 위험 및 기회를 고려하는 방식</strong></h1>
    <br/>
    <p>연결회사의 최고 의사결정기구인 지배기업의 이사회는 중장기 전략 및 사업계획 수립 시, 기후 변화 위험 및 기회 요인을 종합적으로 고려합니다. 기후 변화 위험 및 기회요인을 식별하고 있으며, 식별 기준은 ① 해당 기후 변화 위험 및 기회 요인의 실현 가능성, ② 실현되었을 경우 사업에 대한 영향력 ③ 강제성 ④ 재무적 영향을 고려합니다. 나아가 중요성 평가를 수행하여 식별된 해당 요인이 지배기업에 미치는 영향을 평가합니다.</p>
    <p>지배기업이 중장기 전략에 기후 변화 위험 및 기회 요인을 고려한 대표적인 사례는 배출권거래제입니다. 배출권거래제는 강제성을 띠고 있으며, 적절히 대응하지 못할 경우 재무적으로 배출권 구매에 따른 비용이 크게 증가됩니다. 따라서 당사는 상시적으로 시장 동향을 모니터링하고 있으며, 부족분은 시장 가격에 따라 부채로 설정하여 관리하고 있습니다. 해당 부채는 CEO 및 ESG위원회에 보고됨에 따라 재무적 영향을 최소화하기 위해 운영 효율화(고효율 네트워크 장비 설치 등) 및 설비교체(노후 냉방기 교체, 외기냉방장치 도입 등)를 실시하고 있습니다.</p>
    <p>다른 지속가능성 위험 및 기회와의 상충 고려</p>
    <p>연결회사의 최고 의사결정기구인 지배기업의 이사회는 사업계획이 기후 변화 위험 및 기회에 미치는 영향을 고려할 뿐 아니라, 나아가 다른 지속가능성 위험 및 기회와 상충되는지를 복합적으로 고려합니다. 기후 변화 관련 위험에 대해 연결회사의 온실가스 배출량 감축 목표는 연결회사의 온실가스의 주요 배출원에 해당하는 전기 소모량의 감소에 기반합니다. 다만, 5G 이상의 고대역 주파수 통신 기술의 특성(직진성, 좁은 전송 커버리지)을 고려했을 시, 품질 유지를 위한 통신장비 요구량이 증가하고 있습니다.</p>
    <p>이러한 환경 하에서 서비스 품질의 유지 또는 향상을 위해서는 충분한 통신 인프라의 구축이 전제되어야 하므로 이로 인한 전기소모량 및 온실가스 배출량은 증가하는 구조로 상충 요소가 존재합니다. 연결회사는 지속가능성 관련 위험의 우선순위 선정에 있어 재무적 영향을 기준으로 판단하고 있습니다. 연결회사는 기후 변화 관련 목표의 달성 방안으로 재생에너지 조달을 추진하고 있으며, 재생에너지 조달을 통해 서비스 품질을 유지/향상하는 과정에서 온실가스 배출량에 대한 상충 요소는 해소 가능한 영역으로 판단하고 있습니다.</p>

        <h1><strong>How we manage climate-related risk (threats and opportunities)</strong></h1>
        <br/>
    <p>Climate change creates new risks and influences the nature, scale and frequency of the potential impacts of many existing risks (not primarily caused by climate change) across our risk profile. This CTAP has been developed to reflect the identification and management of climate-related risks (threats and opportunities) that we face. We take an enterprise approach to risk management and operate to one Risk Framework for all risks including climate-related risks (threats and opportunities).</p>

    <p>Our Risk Framework requires the identification and management of risks to be embedded in business activities and provides requirements and guidance on the tools and processes to manage current and emerging risks. Our mandatory minimum performance requirements for risk management and the Climate Change Global Standard set the minimum requirements to manage climate-related risks and apply across our operated assets, functions, and regional teams, and our decision-making processes for procurement, sales and marketing.</p>

    <p>We interpret external signals associated with transition risk and physical climate-related risk, including material changes in climate-related political dynamics, policy and regulation, including legal developments, carbon pricing and markets, stakeholder sentiments, and industry developments. We also interpret external events and trends associated with transition and physical climate-related risk which may include, scientific, policy, legal, reputation and market developments. This supports the identification and management of climate-related risks at BHP.</p>

     <h1><strong>Performance and Remuneration</strong></h1>
     <br/>
    <p>Our Board Compensation and Human Capital Committee oversees the governance of our pay-for-performance compensation philosophy, which focuses on pay for performance over the long-term, as well as on an annual basis. Performance considerations encompass both financial and nonfinancial measures, including the manner in which results are achieved for the Company, LOBs, and individual employees.</p>
     <br/>

    <p>At the start of each year, goals aligned to the tenets of Responsible Growth, including growing in a sustainable manner, are established for each executive officer, and progress toward meeting those goals is tracked on scorecards and taken into consideration by the Board’s Compensation and Human Capital Committee when making compensation decisions. For example:</p>
     <br/>

    <ul>
        <li>•Our executive officer team’s performance dashboards contain sustainability metrics that are tracked and reported to the Board. The Board also reviews and considers progress toward our $1.5 trillion sustainable finance goal and Net Zero goal in its evaluation of pay-for-performance.</li>
    </ul>
     <br/>

    <p>Additionally, below and to the right are other ways sustainability is evaluated across the company.</p>
     <br/>

    <ul>
        <li>•FLUs, such as the GSFG, Renewable Energy Finance, and SBSG, focus directly on climate innovation and environment-related revenue streams and are evaluated based on the management of these opportunities as well as engagement with our eight LOBs to finance the environmental transition in alignment with the United Nations 17 Sustainable Development Goals (U.N. SDGs).</li>
        <li>•The GEG is responsible for the Company’s environmental strategy, including our work to drive progress toward our Net Zero goal and other environmental commitments and is evaluated on advancement in these areas.</li>
        <li>•The chief procurement officer leads the Company’s responsible sourcing strategy and is evaluated on success in these areas. The Third Party Program is tasked with engaging suppliers on the management of climate change and delivering on our climate-related supplier engagement targets.</li>
        <li>•Teams responsible for delivering operational and supply chain greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions reductions and maintaining carbon neutrality include Global Real Estate Services, Global Technology, Global Operations, Consumer, the Third Party Program, Corporate and Executive Travel Services, and GEG. Team performance is evaluated based on successfully implementing activities and initiatives that support energy efficiency and manage and help reduce GHG emissions.</li>
    </ul>

          <h1><strong>Operational GHG Emissions Risk</strong></h1>
          <br/>
    <p>We conduct annual long-term strategic planning for our operated assets, which includes detailed operational GHG emissions reduction planning. As part of this, we assess projects using criteria such as technology readiness, operational risk, and overall risk associated with the likelihood of progression. We also consider project success at the planned scale of implementation required to meet our medium-term target and achieve our long-term net zero goal. Impacts to our operational GHG emissions are included in our investment risk management framework for minor projects, major capital projects, transactions, and greenfield exploration projects.</p>
    <p>Project teams are required to identify a potential investment’s operational GHG emissions profile and the availability of GHG emission abatement solutions to assess the impact on our operational GHG emissions medium-term target and long-term net zero goal. We then use this planning process to prioritize and accelerate the delivery of our operational GHG emission reduction strategy where possible. This typically includes a focus on technologies and GHG emission sources that are not as well progressed or that do not have as high a level of technology or commercial readiness. We continue to study and identify options to accelerate our strategy, including by working with our suppliers, others in the industry, and our innovation and BHP Ventures teams to source new ideas or gain access to new technologies.</p>
    <br/>
    <h2><strong>CEO and ELT Remuneration</strong></h2>
    <br/>
    <p>Our executive remuneration framework is aligned with key drivers of our business strategy, to help deliver the short-, medium- and long-term success of BHP and create value for shareholders and other stakeholders and partners. Strategic drivers are reflected in incentive plan performance measures linking executive incentives to actual performance. The amount of remuneration actually received by executives each year depends on the achievement of business and individual performance measures that generate sustained shareholder value.</p>

    <p>Before deciding on the final incentive outcomes for the CEO and other executives, the People and Remuneration Committee considers the achievement of pre-determined performance measures. In FY2020, we strengthened the link between executive remuneration and the delivery of our climate change strategy, coinciding with the implementation of a revised remuneration framework, comprising fixed remuneration, the Cash and Deferred Plan (CDP), and Long Term Incentive Plan. The CDP is an annual cash and equity award that encourages and focuses executives’ efforts for the relevant financial year on the delivery of our strategic priorities, balancing financial and non-financial performance, to deliver short-, medium-, and long-term success aligned to our purpose.</p>

    <p>For FY2025, the CDP scorecard includes performance measures related to safety and sustainability (25 per cent weighting), financial (50 per cent weighting), and group and personal objectives (25 per cent weighting). CDP awards are provided as cash and deferred shares vesting in two and five years, respectively. Vesting of five-year deferred shares under the CDP is underpinned by a holistic review of performance at the end of the five-year vesting period, including a review of safety and sustainability performance over the five-year period. The safety and sustainability-related targets include significant health, safety, environment, and community (HSEC) events, climate change, and Indigenous partnerships. Climate change-related scorecard targets will represent 10 per cent weighting in the CDP scorecard for FY2025 and have been in place each year since FY2020.</p>

    <p>These performance measures seek to motivate executives to achieve and exceed internal targets, which support the delivery of our GHG emissions targets and goals in this CTAP. A CDP award is determined based on the assessment of each scorecard performance measure by the People and Remuneration Committee and the Board, with guidance provided by other relevant Board Committees, including the Sustainability Committee with respect to safety and sustainability targets and outcomes.</p>

    <p>For FY2025, our CDP climate-related performance measures include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>•Reduction in operational GHG emissions (Scopes 1 and 2 emissions from our operated assets).</li>
        <li>•Deliver the FY2025 actions in the approved climate adaptation work program.</li>
        <li>•Inclusion of capital for mitigating/preventative controls for physical climate-related risks in future plans.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Climate change measures, including reduction in operational GHG emissions, play a meaningful role in the determination of remuneration outcomes for our CEO and other ELT members.</p>
